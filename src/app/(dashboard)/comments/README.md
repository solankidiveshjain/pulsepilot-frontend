# Comments Interface Implementation

This is the PulsePilot frontend's Comment Management System, a comprehensive solution for managing, filtering, and interacting with comments across various platforms. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns with layered components for maintainability and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a layered architecture with:

1. **Models Layer** (`src/components/comments/models/`)

   - Data types and transformation functions
   - Zod schema validation for robust type safety
   - Utilities for thread building and response transformations

2. **State Layer** (`src/components/comments/state/`)

   - Zustand store with selector pattern
   - React Query integration for server state
   - Custom hooks for accessing specific state slices

3. **Container Layer** (`src/components/comments/containers/`)

   - `CommentsContainer`: Main container handling data and state
   - `CommentsLayout`: Layout component for responsive design

4. **UI Layer** (`src/components/comments/ui/`)
   - Pure presentational components
   - React-window virtualization for optimal performance
   - Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Key Features

- **Virtualized List**: Uses `react-window` with dynamic measurement for optimal performance with large datasets
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types with discriminated unions for complex states
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- **Error Handling**: ErrorBoundary components to prevent cascading failures
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop layouts with adaptive components
- **Performance Optimizations**: Memoization, lazy loading, and virtualization

## Technology Stack

- **React 19 Compatible**: No legacy ref hacks or `@ts-expect-error`
- **Virtualization**: `react-window` with dynamic measurement
- **State Management**: Zustand with selectors
- **Server State**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive classes
- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas

## Implementation Details

### State Management

The Zustand store (`useCommentsStore`) provides a centralized state management solution with selector functions for accessing specific parts of the state:

```typescript
// Access only selected comments
const { selectedComments, toggleComment } = useSelectedComments();

// Access only expanded threads
const { expandedThreads, toggleThread } = useExpandedThreads();
```

### Data Fetching

React Query is used for data fetching, with support for:

- Pagination with infinite loading
- Caching with appropriate stale times
- Loading, error, and empty states
- Optimistic updates for bulk actions

### Virtualization

The `VirtualizedCommentList` component uses `react-window` with dynamic height measurement to efficiently render large lists:

- Only renders visible items
- Measures and caches item heights
- Supports expanding/collapsing of nested replies
- Optimizes scroll performance

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to different screen sizes:

- Desktop: 3-column layout with filter sidebar, comment feed, and post details
- Mobile: Stack layout with slide-over panels for filters and post details
- Consistent padding and spacing following the design system

## Key Components

- `CommentsContainer`: Main container component managing state and data flow
- `VirtualizedCommentList`: Virtualized list component for efficient rendering
- `CommentCard`: Presentation component for individual comments
- `FilterSidebar`: Component for filter selection and management
- `PostDetailsPanel`: Component for displaying post details

## Usage

The Comments interface is accessible at `/comments` and requires no additional configuration. It automatically fetches comments from the API and provides filtering, sorting, and interaction capabilities.
